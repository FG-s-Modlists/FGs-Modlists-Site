### Wabbajack Issues

---

#### “A mod failed to download.”

First, you can try restarting the install once, you may also try enabling the Network Workaround option in the settings for Wabbajack to see if it will download the file after enabling that setting.

Next, check the list of commonly failing files further down on this page, some files hosted on certain file hosting sites are prone to failing at times.

Otherwise: wait for an update to the list. Please do not ask for anyone to share old files. I work a full-time job in addition to several other personal projects, of which Living Skyrim is just one. If installs are failing, I will try to update as quickly as possible but sometimes it may be a couple of days before I can get to it.

#### “Wabbajack says I’m out of requests.”

Nexus Premium is limited to 2500 downloads in a given 24 hour timeframe. Usually this limit resets around 9PM Eastern Time. Wait for your limit to reset and you’ll be able to proceed. Usually this only occurs after attempting to download the list multiple times in a row or when attempting to download multiple lists in the same 24 hour window.

#### “Can I pause the installation?”

Yes, just close Wabbajack. When you start the installation process again it will pick up from where it left off.

#### “Can I delete the downloads folder after installing?”

Yes, but remember that if you need to update the list you will have to download all of the mods that have updated again.

### Gameplay Issues

---

#### "How do I start the Main Quest?"

Alternate Perspective modifies how the main quest begins in Living Skyrim 3. With any start except for the Dragonborn start, Helgen will remain intact as a fully functional town until such time that you decide to start the main story. To begin the main Skyrim story, go to Helgen and enter the inn. Due to a current bug with TrueHUD, you will have to skip a portion of the intro. To do so, go behind the counter and enter the basement. Go through a few locked doors until you exit to Skyrim, where you'll find the Messenger dragon from the starting room. Speak with him and choose to skip the intro, and select the Keep when prompted. 

#### “The Main Quest doesn’t proceed after retrieving the Dragonstone.”

#### “Tolfdir doesn’t invite me to Saarthal right away.”

Read this modpage: [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704)

#### "I can't join the Stormcloaks/Imperial Legion."

Start the main quest and progress it to at least Way of the Voice. See above questions for how to start the main quest.

#### "I can't use spells with a weapon equipped! I Can't power attack!"

Engarde changes the way these combat functions work. To use a spell in your characters *right* hand: hold the Modifier hotkey while you right click (default Shift)
Please note that swapping mouse buttons for attacks can cause issues with this. You will need to configure things yourself if you do this.
Power attacks have their own keybind (Default Mouse 3). These can be changed at any time in the Engarde MCM

#### “Can I access RaceMenu after character creation?”

Only if you are not changing your character’s gender or race. Changing gender/race will cause issues with powers and passive buffs your character has.

#### “My screen is zoomed in or weirdly off-center.”

Check the SSE Display Tweaks INI file to make sure you have the resolution for your screen set correctly. You may also need to check BethINI or the Skyrim INI files to make sure they all match your screen’s resolution.

#### "How can I adjust graphical/resolution settings?"

A program called BethINI is included with the Living Skyrim installation. You can find it in the `Living Skyrim\Tools\BethINI` folder. Run the program (**MAKE SURE Mod Organizer IS CLOSED**) and adjust your settings as necessary.

#### "Interiors are too dark/bright."

Instructions here are for the default ENB, if you have changed it you will need to search for the settings on your own. Open the ENB configuration menu in game with `Shift+Enter` Navigate to the `ENBEffect.fx` menu on the right side of the configuration screen. You will see two options near the top of this section, The first is the `Nights` modifier, Set this to a lower number between 0.5 and 1 to make nights brighter outdoors. Set it to a number between 1 and 2 to make them darker. Repeat this for the `Interiors` setting using the same number scale. Press **Save Configuration** in the top left and then close the menu using `Shift+Enter` again. ***DO NOT CLICK APPLY CHANGES*** This will load the configuration from the .ini file and you will lose your changes.

#### “MO2 cannot find SKSE.”

You’ll need to manually set the path for SKSE using the Edit Executables menu in MO2. Set it to `[install folder]\Stock Game\skse64_loader.exe`. Alternatively your Antivirus software may be interfering with the installation, set exceptions and/or disable as necessary.

#### “Can I use a controller?”

I strongly advise against it. With as many mods as there are in the list, you’ll need a full breadth of keyboard keys to activate and use every feature. If you absolutely must play with a controller, please, for the love of all that is holy, use Gamepad++.

#### “My game freezes when saving.”

Make sure you’ve disabled all overlays for Skyrim. The most common ones are Discord, Steam, and nVidia. Other overlays from things like MSI Afterburner and f.lux have also been known to cause issues.

#### “Can I play this list on a 75/100/144hz screen?”

Yes. Display Tweaks SSE is included to allow higher refresh rates.

#### “Can I use this list on an ultrawide monitor?”

Yes, Nordic UI patches for 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios are included by default. Just make sure to enable the correct version for your aspect ratio in the left pane of MO2 under the 'Configuration Specific' seperator.

#### Nudity?

By default, Living Skyrim has every character be never nude. Underwear is worn by all NPCs and the player character and cannot be unequipped. Support is not provided for making the list Nude.
