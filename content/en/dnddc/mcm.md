Current MCM Document Version: 10/7/2021 2.2.0

{{< tip "warning" >}}
**WARNING!**

**Before doing anything with the MCM, wait for all the messages in the top left to finish appearing. Then, save your game and load the save you just created. Once that save has loaded, you must once again wait for all messages in the top left to disappear (usually indicated by the "SexLab Ready!" message). When you do this, you will receive a popup about SLSF and its Papyrus storage. This is normal and will be fixed by following the below steps.**

**Additionally, you should do the steps here in the order they are presented.**
{{< /tip >}} 

For Dungeons & Deviousness to work properly, the MCM and Skyrim in-game settings should be set as follows.

## A Word About Difficulty
Before you get started, a word about difficulty: Dungeons & Deviousness is intended to be a semi-hardcore list with survival elements and a relatively high difficulty curve. That said, there are several mods included in the list that affect difficulty and changing the in-game difficulty will do nothing. There is exactly one difficulty for Dungeons & Deviousness Director's Cut: the one that comes with the list. If it's too hard, too bad.

That said, the following three mods (AVA, ELSA, and CC&BR) are included to make it actually possible to play the list. Skipping them is possible, but you are strongly advised against skipping them under any and all circumstances.

## Character Creation
Character creation in Dungeons & Deviousness is going to be slightly different than you're used to. Follow the directions below in the order they are presented to make sure you set up you character correctly.

Also, before you begin, if you're going to use a RaceMenu preset, it's possible that they will look weird on initial load. You can load the head sculpt for your chosen preset from RaceMenu's Sculpt menu. Doing so should fix any oddities with head shapes and such. Note that not every preset has a head sculpt to load, you should only do this if it looks weird.

{{< tip "warning" >}}
**WARNING!**

**Dungeons & Deviousness only functions correctly with female player characters.**

## AVA & ELSA
Immediately after you create your character, you'll be prompted to assign your attributes using AVA. You may do this now or later by selecting the appropriate response when the popup appears. If you choose to do this later, you'll be given a power in your Powers/Shouts menu that you can activate to assign your attributes. You should select either Expert or Master when prompted.

ELSA gives you a bonus to a single skill based on your character's background. To do this, select the "Reflect" option from your Power/Shout menu and then press the Shout key (Usually Z) to select your background.

The choices you make in the AVA and ELSA menus are permanent and cannot be changed without starting a new character!

## Classic Classes & Birthsigns Reimagined
You will start the game with a book in your inventory called "Classic Classes". Read this book to select a class and birthsign for your character. The book will be removed after you select a class and birthsign. You can still change your birthsign/standing stone by finding the appropriate one in Skyrim's game world.

The choices you make in the CC&BR menu are permanent and cannot be changed without starting a new character!

{{< tip >}}
**Important!** 

Now, go look at what all has been set by the Cursed Loot import and configure Cursed Loot to your liking. The included preset is tough but fair, however, I'd be willing to guarantee you'll want to tweak it. Cursed Loot is very subjective.
