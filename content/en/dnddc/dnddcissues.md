### "I get stuck in certain animations!"

This is usually caused by script lag. There’s really no way around it, it will happen sometimes. Normally, you can open the console using the tilde key (~) on your keyboard or pause the game (Esc) for a few seconds and it will catch up. If you’re still stuck after doing that, you may need to reload an earlier save. Unfortunately the combination of mods being used can have this happen on occasion. Short of rewriting the scripts used, there’s really no way to fix it. Save frequently just in case this does happen to you.

### “The Main Quest doesn’t proceed after retrieving the Dragonstone.”

### “Can I access RaceMenu after character creation?”

Only if you are not changing your character’s gender or race. Changing gender/race will cause issues with powers and passive buffs your character has.

### “Can I change my attributes after starting?”

No. The choices you make are permanent. You can increase your attributes through various methods, refer to this modpage for more details: AVA

### “My screen is zoomed in or weirdly off-center.”

Check the SSE Display Tweaks INI file to make sure you have the resolution for your screen set correctly. You may also need to check BethINI or the Skyrim INI files to make sure they all match your screen’s resolution.

### “MO2 cannot find SKSE.”

You’ll need to manually set the path for SKSE using the Edit Executables menu in MO2. Also make sure you have followed the Game Folder Files step of this readme.

### “Can I use a controller?”

No. And to answer your next question, because I fucking said so.

### “My game freezes when saving.”

Make sure you’ve disabled all overlays for Skyrim. The most common ones are Discord, Steam, and nVidia. Other overlays from things like MSI Afterburner and f.lux have also been known to cause issues.

### “Can I play this list on a 75/100/144hz screen?”

Yes. Display Tweaks SSE is included to allow higher refresh rates.

### “Can I use this list on an ultrawide monitor?”

No.
