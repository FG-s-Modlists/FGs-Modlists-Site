I swear I don't mean to go this long between posts. It just kinda happens.

Anyway, Living Skyrim 3.6.0 is coming on November 6th. It's going to be a bug fix update. All the bugs. Every last one. Internally we've been calling it The Exterminatus Update. Silly, perhaps. But accurate. The goal is to clear out as many bugs on the LS Github as possible. I don't plan to add, remove, or replace any mods. Just bug fixes and mod updates. The goal is to have 3.6.0 be a "long term" build of the list. I wouldn't say 3.6.0 is the version where I'll call LS "complete", but it definitely is going to be the version I'd be happy leaving alone for a while.

MOISE is due for an update too. That'll come later in November probably. Nothing major, just some bug fixes and maybe a new mod or two. We'll see.

D&DDC is also due for an update, and soon. It's currently not able to be installed and I need to fix that. Expect that to happen before LS 3.6.0 drops.

PoTD has just released and I'm very happy with the list. Out of all of my lists, POTD and MOISE are the two that I'd consider "complete". As in, they don't really need updates except for bug fixes and I don't have any major plans for them going forward.

Now for some unfortunate news. Fallout 3 received an update recently that broke FOSE. This, as I'm sure you can imagine, is a problem for President Eden's Paradise. So, until further notice, that list is on hold. I want to make the list, but can't until FOSE updates. You can trust I'll be keeping a very close eye on it to see when it updates and will resume working on PEP when it does.

In other news, we just released a second batch of Merlyn emotes that were directly funded by Patreon, so again, thank you for contributing. It means more than you know. You can be on the lookout for a third set of Merlyn emotes in the coming months.

As for everything else... The website is in a great spot. I don't feel the need to make any changes or overhauls of it. I'm very happy with its theme, layout, content, and functionality. The Discord is running very smoothly with over 12000 members. Wow. That's insane, and humbling. Thank you.

Oh, and November 2nd is my birthday. Yay.

Anyway. Things are good. How are you? I hope you're well, and if you're not, I hope it passes soon for you.

Cheers.

FG
