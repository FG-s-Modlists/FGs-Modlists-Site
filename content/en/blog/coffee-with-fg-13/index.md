I've mostly been trying to keep my head down, but there's a lot happening in the Wabbajack and related modding communities at the moment. It's nearly impossible to not get involved. 

That said, I have nothing to say about what's happening. I'm allergic to drama and firmly in the camp of "what will happen, will happen." I feel no need to add my opinion to the storm that's raging, nor the need to try and sway people to my viewpoint. So I won't.

Instead, I'll say that I'm waiting for things to calm down before doing any sort of list updates. Mods are coming and going, seemingly at random and on a whim, so compiling what's supposed to be a long-term update for Living Skyrim (yes, I'm talking about 3.3.0) is a bit of a dicey proposition at the moment. The same goes for all my lists. We'll see what happens over the next few days or week, and hopefully outside events will be in a stable enough state for me to resume working on them.

In the meantime, here's something fun:

We'll see where that broken road leads eventually. Maybe in a couple of months I'll have more details to share about that. 

Cheers.
