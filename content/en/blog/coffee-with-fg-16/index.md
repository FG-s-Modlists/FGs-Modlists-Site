*Sip.*

Let's talk modlists.

LS3 is doing very well. There's some minor bugs that need to be addressed, but I feel like overall the list is in a good spot. I'm going to hold off updating it for a little while - now's a good time to start a long playthrough if you were trying to wait for the next update.

D&DDC will be updated by the end of the week. It's going to be a decently sized update, but don't expect anything too major.

MOISE is next to get an update. It'll have some bug fixes, but again, don't expect anything too major. That should happen some time next week.

I'm still working on setting up Day7 so they can try to bring back Atelier. No further news on that front.

And now for the most exciting news of this post: I'm ready to announce the "what's next" for FG's Modlists.

You may remember a while ago I posted a teaser screenshot of what appeared to be Fallout. If you guessed that, you guessed correctly. President Eden's Paradise is a Fallout 3 (no, not Tale of Two Wastelands or Fallout New Vegas) list. The best way I know to describe it is this: Living Skyrim Lite, but in Fallout. New graphics, new content, and a smattering of new NPCs. It will require the GOTY version of Fallout 3. More details on that as they become available.

But that's not all. I've also begun development of another Skyrim: Special Edition list. Path of the Dovahkiin aims to be a unique experience among SSE lists. It will of course have new graphics and such, but the primary selling point of PotD is its gameplay. If you're familiar with Diablo 2 or Path of Exile you know what I'm aiming for. Huge perk trees, tons of enemies that respawn very frequently, dungeons that can be replayed over and over, insane loot variety, and of course, endless character build theorycrafting. Again, more details on that as they become available.

Get hype folks, we're just getting started.

Cheers.
