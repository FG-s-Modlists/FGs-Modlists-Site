This past weekend I brought home my first child, and she is every bit as precious as you can imagine.

That said, it's been a pretty exciting month so far and we're only about halfway through. LS 3.4.0 has been awesome so far and we're keeping tabs on the issues rolling in for that. Thankfully it's nothing too major and the transition to the new mods we're using has been relatively seamless.

D&DDC will be receiving an update when I can find the time for it. That should be within a week or so, hopefully. My time, as you can imagine, is fairly heavily split right now and I'm only able to work on it in small increments of time at any given point. I'm relying pretty heavily on those that help me with D&DDC at the moment to keep things moving.

MOISE is also due for an update, but it shouldn't be that major. I think a few mods were removed from Nexus but nothing huge. That's going to happen after D&DDC gets its update.

Atelier is still dead in the water for now. I have someone who may possibly take over maintenance of the list but we'll see what happens with that. 

I don't have any further news on the Fallout front. It's something I'd like to work on, but I need to get the other lists to a good place before I do.

Cheers.

FG
