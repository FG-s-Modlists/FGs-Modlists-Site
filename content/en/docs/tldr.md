## THERE IS NO TL;DR.

**Reading isn't optional.** We provide a comprehensive set of documentation and a [wiki](https://wiki.fgsmodlists.com/), both of which contain a wealth of information. 

The sidebar on the left provides links to the documentation for whatever modlist you're using. If you're looking for specific information, you can use the search box at the top left of the website.

We ask that you search the website before asking any questions. Note that some information is going to be specific to each modlist, so make sure you're on the appropriate pages for the modlist you're playing.
