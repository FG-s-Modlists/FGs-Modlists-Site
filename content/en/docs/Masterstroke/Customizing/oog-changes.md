Some changes to the list must be made in Mod Organizer 2 before launching the game.

### Skin Textures
The default skin texture in Masterstroke is Fair Skin, if that isn't to your liking we have prepared several options for you to choose from. They are listed under the Customization separator in the left pane of MO2. Note that you should only have one skin texture enabled at a time, it is not possible to combine them.

### Bodyslides & OBody
OBody can be safely disabled in the left pane of MO2 if you do not want NPCs to have randomized bodyslide presets. Note that if you disable OBody, you will need to generate your own Bodyslides using Bodyslide. Support is not provided for generating your own Bodyslides.

### Skimpy Outfits
Masterstroke contains additional bodyslides that allow you to select whether male and female outfits are skimpy or not. In the left pane of MO2, you can enable either "Masterstroke Bodyslides (Skimpy Male)" or "Masterstroke Bodyslides (Skimpy Female)", or both if you want everyone to be wearing skimpy outfits.

### Physics
By default, Masterstroke has a few options for the physics applied to your character. In-game, you can switch between CBPC and SMP physics by pressing `Numpad +`. If you find that neither of these is to your liking, you can safely disable `3BA 3BBB CBPC Realistic Firm Breasts Butt and Thighs (3BA RFBBT)` in the left pane of MO2. This will make the CBPC option a bit bouncier.

### Interior Brightness

By default, Lux makes interiors very dark. If you would like to brighten the interiors, enable `Masterstroke Brighter Interiors` in the left pane of MO2.
