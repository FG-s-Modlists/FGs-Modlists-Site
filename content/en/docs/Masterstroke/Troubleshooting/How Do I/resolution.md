## Changing Resolution

To change the resolution of the game, you should use BethINI. To launch BethINI, close Mod Organizer 2 and then navigate to the Tools folder inside your Masterstroke install folder. BethINI can be used to tweak the game settings including resolution.

## Borderless/Windowed Mode

To change the game to windowed or borderless mode, modify the INI inside the SSE Display Tweaks mod folder.
