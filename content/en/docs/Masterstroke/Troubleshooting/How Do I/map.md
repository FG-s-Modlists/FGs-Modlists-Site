  How do I disable the map requirements?
---

Use the following console commands in-game if you want to make changes:

- To disable the map requirement: `set mapreqsdisabled to 1`
- To disable map degradation/breaking: `set MapDegradationDisabled to 1`
- For further tweaking, check the modpage: [Helps To Have A Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37238)
