  How do I show my helmet?

Helmets are automatically shown and hidden by [Equipment Toggle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68540). By default helmets are hidden except for when you either draw your weapons or enter combat. When exiting combat or sheathing your weapons, the helmet will be hidden again.

To manually make your helmet show and hide, press the down arrow key.

You can also configure the Equipment Toggle INI in its mod folder to change when it shows and hides your helmet. Refer to Equipment Toggle's mod page for detailed information on how to modify its INI.
