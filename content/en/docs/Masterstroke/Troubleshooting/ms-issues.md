{{< scrollable-block id="block-1" title="Can I access RaceMenu after character creation?" >}}

Yes, equip the Vanity Mirror you picked up in Realm of Lorkhan.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-2" title="My screen is zoomed in or weirdly off-center." >}}

Check the SSE Display Tweaks INI file to make sure you have the resolution for your screen set correctly. You may also need to check BethINI or the Skyrim INI files to make sure they all match your screen’s resolution.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-3" title="MO2 cannot find SKSE." >}}

You’ll need to manually set the path for SKSE using the Edit Executables menu in MO2. Set it to `[install folder]\Stock Game\skse64_loader.exe`. If you cannot locate this file it has likely been falsely quarantined by your antivirus software.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-4" title="Can I use a controller?" >}}

I strongly advise against it. With as many mods as there are in the list, you’ll need a full breadth of keyboard keys to activate and use every feature. If you absolutely must play with a controller, please, for the love of all that is holy, use Gamepad++.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-5" title="My game freezes when saving." >}}

Make sure you’ve disabled all overlays for Skyrim. The most common ones are Discord, Steam, and nVidia. Other overlays from things like MSI Afterburner and f.lux have also been known to cause issues.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-6" title="Can I play this list on a 75/100/144hz screen?" >}}

Yes. Display Tweaks SSE is included to allow higher refresh rates.

{{</ scrollable-block >}}

{{< scrollable-block id="block-7" title="Can I use this list on an ultrawide monitor?" >}}

Yes, Enable the correct Nordic UI patch for your aspect ratio **AND** the Nordic UI - Ultrawide Fixes and Patches mod in the `Customizaiton` Seperator on the left side of Mod Organizer.
