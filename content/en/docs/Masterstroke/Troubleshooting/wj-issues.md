  Common problems and fixes related to installing the list with Wabbajack.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-1" title="A mod failed to download." >}}

First, you can also try enabling the Network Workaround option in the settings for Wabbajack to see if it will download the file after enabling that setting.

Secondly, Some downloads that commonly fail but do not usually require a list update are listed under this section, please check the files listed there if any of them are the files failing to download.

Otherwise, wait for an update to the list. The long answer is you can try to install the missing mods manually if the files are still available on the Nexus, but again, do not ask for anyone to share old files. I work a full-time job in addition to several other personal projects, of which Masterstroke is just one. If installs are failing, I will try to update as quickly as possible but sometimes it may be a couple of days before I can get to it.

If MEGA downloads are either not downloading correctly or are frozen on the completed download page download the manually from the following links and place them in your Masterstroke download folder:

- [SE.rar](https://mega.nz/folder/xwxwzaDI#J3oxuELfc50dftUKQiIcUg/file/csZHUKrY) For the SE.rar download, open the link and right click on the SE.rar file listed on the webpage, then go to `Download` , then click `Standard Download`

{{< scrollable-block id="block-4" title="Core Masterstroke Files are failling to download." >}}

Masterstroke includes a number of custom output mods and bodyslides that need to be downloaded, if any of the Masterstroke files are failing to download, visit the [FG's Modlists Output Repository](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75106) to download the files required. Put them into the downloads folder you specified when starting the installation process, Wabbajack will handle installing the files for you. Do not extract any of the archives you download.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-5" title="Wabbajack says I’m out of requests." >}}

Nexus Premium is limited to 2500 downloads in a given 24 hour timeframe. Usually this limit resets around 9PM Eastern Time. Wait for your limit to reset and you’ll be able to proceed. Usually this only occurs after attempting to download the list multiple times in a row or when attempting to download multiple lists in the same 24 hour window.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-6" title="Can I pause the installation?" >}}

Yes, just close Wabbajack. When you start the installation process again it will pick up from where it left off.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-7" title="Can I delete the downloads folder after installing?" >}}

Yes, but remember that if you need to update the list you will have to download all of the mods that have updated again.

{{< scrollable-block id="block-10" title="Skyrim Game files are failing to download." >}}

If your Skyrim game files (SkyrimSE.exe, Data_Skyrim.esm, Data_Skyrim - Textures0.bsa, etc.) are failing to download this is most commonly caused by your Skyrim Special Edition being set to a language other than English in Steam, check this first. If you continue to get errors on these files verify your game files using Steam.
