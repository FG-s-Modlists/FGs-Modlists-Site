    Steps to complete before installing Masterstroke.

Before you get started installing or playing Masterstroke, it's important to note a few things:

{{< alert color="info" title="Info">}}
<div class="alert-icon">‚ÑπÔ∏è</div>
Info blocks like this provide more information regarding a step of the guides, usually an image.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="important" title="Important!">}}
<div class="alert-icon">‚ö†Ô∏è</div>
Sections labeled important like this one will tell you when you need to pay extra attention to something.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="danger" title="Warning!" >}}
<div class="alert-icon">üõë</div>
Warning blocks like this one will warn you when you absolutely must not forget to do something. Failure to heed warning blocks is cause for disaster.
{{< /alert >}}

- If you instead only wish for a brief overview of the major changes this modlist makes, you should refer to the [Important Mods](/docs/masterstroke/beginners-guide/importantmods) You Need to Know About section of this document.
- Autosaves for Masterstroke are disabled. You should make your quicksave button your best friend (usually, the F5 key).
- Continuing the last point, it is always better to save **before** entering a loading screen instead of after. After a loading screen it is very likely that scripts will be running for at least 30 seconds, so if you must save after a loading screen, at least wait that long before doing so. When practical, try to avoid saving during combat.
- In Masterstroke, NPCs and player characters are nude while wearing no armor/clothing.
- By default, Masterstroke has the game running in exclusive fullscreen mode to assist with game performance.
