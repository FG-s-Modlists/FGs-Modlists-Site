Some content is not to everyone's tastes and can be safely disabled if you are not a fan of that content.

### Fill Her Up
In this MCM you can modify or disable the mechanics related to being filled with fluids.

### Gender Bender
While this only works with female player characters, Gender Bender can be optionally enabled or disabled if you either want or don't  want the ability to add a schlong to your character. It is recommended you leave this disabled if you do not want to play as a futa/femboy/trans character, but should be enabled if you do want to play as a futa/femboy/trans character. You can also enable futa NPCs using Gender Bender.
