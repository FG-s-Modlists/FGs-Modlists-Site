## Additional Requirements
### Nexus Premium
You are not required to have Nexus Premium to install Path of the Dovahkiin, however, it is highly recommended. Nexus Premium will cut your install time to a fraction of what it would be by automating both the mod download and mod install processes of installing the list.

### Storage Space
As of version 1.0.0, Path of the Dovahkiin requires 158GB of hard drive space on top of the ~11GB Skyrim: Special Edition base files. (This number *includes* the download size). Installing to an SSD/NVMe is not required, but also highly recommended. The faster the drive you install the list onto, the faster the installation process will run and the faster the game will go through loading screens when playing.

## More About System Specifications
Path of the Dovahkiin requires a good to excellent computer to run. Textures range from 512x512 to 4K and everything in between. The following system is ForgottenGlory's personal computer and is able to run the list at a constant 60FPS including ENB at 1440p monitor resolution.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X @ 4.2GHz
- RAM: G.Skill TridentZ Neo 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16
- GPU: nVidia RTX 2080 Super 8GB (8192MB actual)
- Monitor: Dell S2716DGR 2560x1440 @ 144hz
- Storage: Sabrent Rocket 2TB M.2 NVMe 2280; Samsung EVO 860 250GB; SeaGate Barracuda 2TB 7200RPM

In general, it is recommended that you have a processor with a clock speed of at least 3GHz and a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM. 4GB graphics cards may be able to run the list if you do not use ENB, but it is not guaranteed.

As for RAM, 16GB is the recommended specification for running the list. 32GB is the ideal amount, and anything more than that is honestly overkill for this list.
