Before you get started installing or playing Path of the Dovahkiin, it's important to note a few things:

{{< alert icon="⚠️" >}}
**Important!** 

Sections labeled important like this one will tell you when you need to pay extra attention to something.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert icon="🛑" >}}
**WARNING!**

**Warning blocks like this one will warn you when you absolutely must not forget to do something. Failure to heed warning blocks is cause for disaster.**
{{< /alert >}}

- You are not required to have Nexus Premium to install Path of the Dovahkiin , however, it is highly recommended. Nexus Premium will cut your install time to a fraction of what it would be by automating both the mod download and mod install processes of installing the list.
- As of version 1.0.0, Path of the Dovahkiin requires 158GB of hard drive space on top of the ~11GB Skyrim: Special Edition base files. Installing to an SSD/NVMe is not required, but also highly recommended. Download and installation times vary based on your computer and internet speeds, but expect the entire process to take a few hours. If you are installing the list without Nexus Premium, expect the process to take a couple of days of 8+ hour sessions downloading mods.
- To maximize performance, Path of the Dovahkiin should be installed on an SSD drive. While this is not necessary, installing on an HDD will result in extremely long load and startup times aswell as potential performace and stability issues.
- If you are not familiar with the contents of this modlist, a complete documentation of every mod in the list including links to the mods is available on the POTD Modlist Spreadsheet.
- If you instead only wish for a brief overview of the major changes this modlist makes, you should refer to the Important Mods You Need to Know About of this document.
- Autosaves for Path of the Dovahkiin are disabled. You should make your quicksave button your best friend (usually, the F5 key).
- Continuing the last point, it is always better to save **before** entering a loading screen instead of after. After a loading screen it is very likely that scripts will be running for at least 30 seconds, so if you must save after a loading screen, at least wait that long before doing so.
- Wabbajack does support updating an existing installation of a modlist. However, as part of this process, it does delete files that don't match with what it is installing. This includes RaceMenu presets, mods you've added/changed, and possibly even save files. It is a good practice to keep backups of your save files so that you can update safely. Saves are stored within the folder you install Path of the Dovahkiin to.
- In Path of the Dovahkiin, NPCs and player characters are never nude. Underwear is worn by all NPCs and the player character and cannot be unequipped.
- Adding to, changing, or removing from Path of the Dovahkiin is not supported. See the Adding to Path of the Dovahkiin section of this document for more details.
- As many common issues as I could find have been documented in the Common Issues section of this document. Refer to this before asking for support.
- If you want some tips related to getting started playing the list, refer to the Getting Started in Path of the Dovahkiin section of this document.
- By default, Path of the Dovahkiin has the game running in exclusive fullscreen mode to assist with game performance.

### System Specifications
The following system is ForgottenGlory's personal computer and is able to run the list at a constant 60FPS including ENB at 1440p monitor resolution. Use it as a guide to determine how your own computer might run the list.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X @ 4.2GHz
- RAM: G.Skill TridentZ Neo 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16
- GPU: nVidia RTX 2080 Super 8GB (8192MB actual)
- Monitor: Dell S2716DGR 2560x1440 @ 144hz
- Storage: Sabrent Rocket 2TB M.2 NVMe 2280; Samsung EVO 860 250GB; SeaGate Barracuda 2TB 7200RPM

In general, it is recommended that you have a processor with a clock speed of at least 3GHz and a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM. 4GB graphics cards may be able to run the list if you do not use ENB, but it is not guaranteed.

As for RAM, 16GB is the minimum recommended specification for running the list. 32GB is the ideal amount, and anything more than that is honestly overkill for this list.

## Important Mods You Need To Know About
### Character Creation And Builds

Character Creation is fairly straightforward, but you should be aware that you can pick a class using [Sets of Skills](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55535) and its related MCM. By default you can master up to two classes and the classes you master are *permanent*, so plan carefully! More character builds are facilitated by [Vokriinator Black](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26702), which you'll notice in the form of the absolutely enormous perk trees. [Perks From Questing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29402) gives you special, unique perks when you complete certain quest lines. Choose which quests to do that synergize with your character build for maximum effectiveness. 

### Leveling Up

This one's important. You don't level up like normal anymore in Path of the Dovahkiin. Instead, [Gold is XP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20084) is used to... well, make gold into XP. When you sleep and have acquired enough gold, you'll get the option to increase whichever skills you choose. This allows you to pick exactly which direction you want to build your character into. You'll level up quickly until about level 20 or so, and then level ups will start taking longer and longer to receive. Gold is XP also counts gold you receive from selling loot, so keep that in mind. Note that because this mod is included, it's near impossible to max every skill to 100. You'll have to choose carefully and specialize to build your character.

It is possible to "respec" your perk choices. At a high enough player level scroll vendors may sell a 'Scroll of Legends' that can be used to refund all your perk points allowing you to redistribute them. These may be quite expensive though. If you're lucky, however, you might run afoul of one in the wild.

### The Enemy Mods

In general you'll find that enemy variety and quantity is significantly increased thanks to [Increased Enemy Spawns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2470) and [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017). They've also been beefed up by [Enemy Releveler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32211). Dragons are handled by [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310). That said, enemies aren't particularly more difficult, especially once your character build starts to come together. There's also a handful of mods included that increase animal/monster variety. 

Last but not least, enemies respawn every 24 in-game hours thanks to [1 Day Respawn Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5394). Feel free to grind and master dungeons to your heart's content!

### The Magic Mods

[Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170), [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) and [Elemental Destruction Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/440) make up the magic package for Path of the Dovahkiin. Most spells have been overhauled and Triumvirate/EDM allow for most variety in spells and new builds based on those spells.

### The Dungeons

For your enjoyment you'll find [Hammet's Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186), [Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449), [More Bandit Camps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1994), [Dungeons - Revisited](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51798), and [Immersive Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16706) available to explore and conquer.

### Loot, Loot, and More Loot

No ARPG would be complete without an absolutely insane amount of loot. POTD accomplishes this by using [Halgari's RPG Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37736), which provides over *one million* unique pieces of armor and weapons you can collect and use. [GOLD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1796), [Lock Related Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11342), and [Dynamic Dungeon Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10308) round out the loot package by increasing the amount you'll find while dungeon delving.

To counterbalance the increased amount of loot, [Trade & Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081) is used to increase the price of items in shops and decrease the amount of gold your loot sells for.

Last but not least, if you're feeling particularly brave, a tweaked version of [MILK](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15876) is included that pulls from the Halgari's RPG Loot pool to give you random sets if items, gold, and more.

Last but not least, there are a couple of mods that add hidden treasures throughout the world that you can find.

## Nudity?

By default, Path of the Dovahkiin has every character be never nude. Underwear is worn by all NPCs and the player character and cannot be unequipped. Support is not provided for making the list Nude.

## Adding to Path of the Dovahkiin

Many Skyrim modders ask the question: “Can I add mods to Path of the Dovahkiin?” (Or, “Can I remove mods from Path of the Dovahkiin?”, or, “Can I change the mods included with Path of the Dovahkiin?”)

If you are asking this question from a perspective of just installing the mod and expecting it to work, then the answer is a resounding, unequivocal NO.

The longer and slightly more technical answer is: “I don’t know, can you?”

To expand on this: nobody knows whether you can add a certain mod or not. Adding to, changing, or removing from the list isn’t a yes/no question. In 99.9% of cases, the answer is, “Yes, but…“

The “but…” part of that answer refers to the process of installing any mod and stems from a deeply rooted belief that mods are either compatible with each other, or they are not. Assuming that any mod is (or is not) compatible with any other mod is absurd. Every mod can be made to work with every other mod, the real questions you should be asking are: “How much work would it take to add this mod?” and “Do I have the knowledge, tools, and skills to add this mod?”

And unfortunately, the answer to those questions is a resounding, unequivocal, “It depends.” And it depends on the answers to these questions, which you, and only you, can answer: Does it require compatibility/consistency patching in xEdit? Does it require modifications in Creation Kit? Does it require that it be loaded in a certain place in the load order? Does it need additional mods (which also require answers to these questions) to function?

Lastly, I (ForgottenGlory) and the Path of the Dovahkiin development team do not support this in any way, shape, or form. If you’re going to add a mod to Path of the Dovahkiin, you need to be prepared to do it on your own. I understand this isn’t an ideal answer for people relatively new to modding, but you need to understand that hundreds of hours have been spent putting together Path of the Dovahkiin, making it as stable as possible with all the mods working in harmony. Adding a bunch of random mods on top of it and then expecting it to “just work” is naive at best.

“Can I add a mod to Path of the Dovahkiin?”

I don’t know, can you?
