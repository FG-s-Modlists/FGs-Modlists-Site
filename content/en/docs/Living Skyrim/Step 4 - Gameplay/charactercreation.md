## Character Customization Mods

When creating your character, you'll find there are a lot of options that are available to you. From hairs to tattoos to eyes and more, Living Skyrim has included a comprehensive suite of mods that allow you to tweak your character's appearance to exactly what you want. And, if you're struggling to figure out where to begin with character creation, a number of presets made by the Living Skyrim community have been included for you to pick from. In general, you'll have more options for everything.

There is one particular mod you need to be aware of during character creation: [High Poly Head](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/). To have your character use High Poly Head, you'll need to change the head part using the RaceMenu slider of the same name to option 3. Note that if you do use High Poly Head, you may need to do some manual sculpting using the RaceMenu sculpt feature to remove any clipping issues with eyebrows or beards.

Information about the Racemenu presets included with Living Skryim is available on the [Living-Skyrim-4-Character-Presets](https://wiki.fgsmodlists.com/en/living-skyrim/Living-Skyrim-4-Character-Presets) wiki page.

## A Word About Difficulty

Living Skyrim is intended to be played at the Adept difficulty level. If you wish to have a challenge or find the game too difficult, you can and should adjust the game difficulty as you wish. Adept is merely where I (ForgottenGlory) like to play - it provides a decent challenge without being overly difficult.

Also, while fantastic for roleplaying purposes, ELSA and Classic Classes & Birthsigns can make the game significantly easier. If you wish to have a more difficult time of things - especially in combat - you can and should skip setting up ELSA, and CC&B.

## ELSA

If you are going to use it,  ELSA must be configured before leaving the Realm of Lorkhan.

ELSA gives you a bonus to a single skill based on your character's background. To do this, select the "Reflect" option from your Power/Shout menu and then press the Shout key (Usually Z) to select your background. If you are opting to skip ELSA, simply do not activate this power/shout.

The choices you make in the ELSA menus are permanent and cannot be changed without starting a new character!

## Classic Classes & Birthsigns Reimagined
You will start the game with a book in your inventory called "Classic Classes". Read this book to select a class and birthsign for your character. The book can be safely disposed of as you wish. If you want a challenge, try playing without selecting a class/birthsign. You can still select a birthsign by finding the appropriate standing stone at any time. If you wish to skip using CC&B, simply do not read the book and dispose of it as you wish.

The choices you make in the CC&BR menu are permanent and cannot be changed without starting a new character!
