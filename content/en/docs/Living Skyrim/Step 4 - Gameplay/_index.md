## Character Creation

### Character Customization Mods

Living Skyrim offers a wide array of customization options ‚Äì from hair to tattoos and eyes. Use the included mods to perfect your character's look. If you're overwhelmed by choices, try the presets curated by our community.

**üîó Notable Mod:** To use the High Poly Head mod, set the "head part" to option 3 in RaceMenu. Manual sculpting might be needed for eyebrow or beard adjustments.

### A Word About Difficulty

- Recommended Difficulty: Adept. Adjust as per your preference.
- Want a more challenging experience? Consider skipping ELSA and Classic Classes & Birthsigns (CC&B) setups.

### ELSA

{{< alert color="danger" title="Warning!" >}}
<div class="alert-icon">üõë</div>

Configure ELSA before leaving the Realm of Lorkhan.
{{< /alert >}}

To get a skill bonus from ELSA:

1. Open Power/Shout menu.
2. Select "Reflect".
3. Press the Shout key (typically Z).

If you're bypassing ELSA, avoid activating this power/shout. Remember, ELSA choices are irreversible.

### Classic Classes & Birthsigns Reimagined
Upon starting, you'll find a book titled "Classic Classes" in your inventory. Reading it allows you to select a class and birthsign.

- Dispose of the book if not needed.
- For an added challenge, don't pick a class/birthsign.

Remember, CC&BR choices are permanent.
