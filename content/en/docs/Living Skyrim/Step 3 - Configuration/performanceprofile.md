## Performance Profile Explained
Living Skyrim 4 offers two distinct profiles: the Standard profile and the Performance profile. While the Standard profile is designed for a balance of visuals and performance, the Performance profile is tailored for those who seek enhanced game performance. It optimizes settings and mod configurations to ensure a smoother gameplay experience, especially beneficial for systems that might struggle with the Standard profile.

## How to Switch Profiles

Use MO2's Profile selector, positioned in the top left above the mods pane, to seamlessly switch between profiles.
