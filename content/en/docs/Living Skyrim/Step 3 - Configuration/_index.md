## Mod Organizer 2

Among other things, Wabbajack has installed a copy of Mod Organizer 2 for you. This copy of Mod Organizer 2 is specific to Living Skyrim and will not affect any other modlists you have installed.

1. Inside your Living Skyrim folder, locate and launch ModOrganizer.exe. If this is not inside the folder, your installation has failed and you need to consult the Common Issues section of this document.

2. Mod Organizer 2 will have a dark theme already selected for you. If it does not, something has gone wrong and you will need to start over at the Installing the List section of this document.
3. A dialogue may appear and ask if you want to associate Mod Organizer with .nxm links. Click Yes. If this dialogue does not appear, it is not an issue and means you‚Äôve likely already done this.
4. Another dialogue may appear asking you to update the game's registry path. Click Yes on this popup if it appears. If it does not appear, it is not an issue and likely means you've already done this.

## Configuration

There are three mods that can be optionally enabled, depending on your preferences and computer configuration. 

The first is Nordic UI 32x9 or 21x9. This should only be enabled if you are using a 21:9 or 32:9 monitor at 2560x1080 resolution or higher. Enable whichever one matches your screen's aspect ratio and only that one.

The second is QuickLoot, which adds a Fallout 4 style loot menu to bodies, containers, etc. This mod provides a significant quality of life improvement to looting, however it can cause issues with mods that run scripts upon looting certain objects. Enable it, or don't, it's entirely up to your personal preference. If you do enable it, it's recommended that you also enable the retexture for it to match the rest of the Skyrim UI.

### ENB
By default, Living Skyrim comes bundled with six ENB presets that you can choose between: Rudy Zangdar's Edit, Culminated (Performance and Quality), iiENB, Pi-CHO (Performance and Quality), Silent Horizons, and Semirealis (Performance and Quality). ENB is turned on by default and the Rudy Zangdar's Edit preset is already enabled for you.

To switch between presets, launch ENB Organizer from within Mod Organizer 2. If you receive a message about ENB Organizer being unable to update, this is normal and can be safely ignored. Now, follow these instructions:

1. Click the three lines in the top left corner of ENB Organizer.
2. Click "Presets" in the menu that appears.
3. Note that by default Rudy Zangdar's Edit is enabled, indicated by the blue toggle under its name. 
4. Click on the toggle for any enabled presets (it should only be one at any given time) to disable it.
5. Click on the toggle under any other preset to enable it.
6. Wait 10 seconds, then you're done!

**You should only ever have one ENB preset enabled. Having multiple enabled is a recipe for a Bad Time‚Ñ¢.**

Note that ENB can put a very heavy strain on weaker computers. If you would like to turn off ENB, simply press Shift+F12 while in-game.

Support is not provided for adding additional ENB options to the modlist. If you want to add more options, you need to know how to use ENB Organizer and be familiar with the Stock Game feature that Living Skyrim uses.
