## Mod Organizer 2

Wabbajack furnishes you with a specialized version of Mod Organizer 2 exclusively for Living Skyrim, ensuring no interference with any other modlists.

1. Navigate to your Living Skyrim directory and execute `ModOrganizer.exe`.

1. An custom LS4 MO2 theme will greet you. If not, revisit Step 2 - Installation.
2. If prompted, choose 'Yes' to associate Mod Organizer with .nxm links. If there's no prompt, you've likely done this step previously.
3. Similarly, if asked to update the game's registry path, click 'Yes'. If absent, you've likely done this step previously.

## Configuration

Three mods are available for tailored experience:

- Nordic UI 32x9/21x9: Activate only if your monitor's resolution is 2560x1080 or higher, and matches either 21:9 or 32:9 ratios.
- QuickLoot: Enhances looting experience, resembling Fallout 4. It may conflict with certain scripted mods. If activated, also activate the matching retexture.

### ENB
Living Skyrim presents six selectable ENB presets, with Rudy Zangdar's Edit being the default.

To navigate ENB presets:

1. Initiate ENB Organizer within Mod Organizer 2. Disregard any update-related notifications; they're typical.
2. Select the three-line icon at the top left.
3. Choose "Presets."
4. Disable any active preset by clicking its toggle.
5. Activate your preferred preset with its toggle.
6. Pause for a moment (10 seconds), and you're set!

**Always maintain just one active ENB preset to prevent potential complications.**

If ENB burdens your system, it can be toggled on and off in-game using Shift+F12.

While the bundled presets are comprehensive, no support is provided for adding additional ENB presets.
