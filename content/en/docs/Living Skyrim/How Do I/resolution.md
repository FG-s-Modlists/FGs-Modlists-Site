  How do I change the game's resolution?
---

## Changing Resolution

To change the resolution of the game, you should use BethINI. To launch BethINI, close Mod Organizer 2 and then navigate to the Tools folder inside your Living Skyrim install folder. BethINI can be used to tweak the game settings including resolution. Please note that if you are using the Performance profile, you will need to switch the INI Path in Bethini's Setup tab.

## Borderless/Windowed Mode

To change the game to windowed or borderless mode, modify the INI inside the SSE Display Tweaks mod folder.
