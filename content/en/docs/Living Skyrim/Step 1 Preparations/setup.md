### Steam & SSE Setup
{{< alert color="danger" title="Warning!" >}}
<div class="alert-icon">🛑</div>

Make sure Skyrim: Special Edition is the latest version on Steam. If you’ve made changes or not updated, use Steam to verify game files. This avoids installation troubles.

Before proceeding with installation, it’s important that your Steam and Skyrim Special Edition install are configured correctly.

1. Don’t put your Steam library in Program Files, Desktop, Documents, or Downloads. It can cause problems. Look online for guides on moving your Steam library.
2. Need a fresh Skyrim: Special Edition? Here's how:
  - Uninstall it in Steam. (Right-click > Manage > Uninstall)
  - Remove leftover files. (Right-click > Manage > Browse Local Files)
  - Reinstall Skyrim: Special Edition.
3. Set Skyrim to update only when you open it in Steam. (Right-click > Properties > Updates)
4. Turn off the Steam Overlay for Skyrim. (Right-click > Properties > General)
5. Make sure Skyrim's language is English. (Right-click > Properties > Language)

After that, launch Skyrim to make sure everything is ready. Close it once the settings adjust. Wabbajack needs this step to work properly.

### Wabbajack Preparations
We’ll now setup the folders needed for the installation to proceed smoothly.

1. Make two empty folders: “Wabbajack” and “Living Skyrim.”

2. These folders shouldn't be in: Skyrim folder, Program Files, Documents, Downloads, or Desktop.
3. "Wabbajack" and "Living Skyrim" shouldn't be inside one another.
4. Check these folders are empty. If not, empty them.
5. Download the latest Wabbajack from their website: [Wabbajack.](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
6. Put the Wabbajack.exe in the “Wabbajack” folder.

**Set up your folders right! If not, the install might fail. Don’t do this: `[install drive]\Wabbajack\Living Skyrim.`**
