  The most important mods you need to know about.
---

Many Skyrim modders ask the question: “Can I add mods to Living Skyrim?” (Or, “Can I remove mods from Living Skyrim?”, or, “Can I change the mods included with Living Skyrim?”)

If you are asking this question from a perspective of just installing the mod and expecting it to work, then the answer is a resounding, unequivocal NO.

The longer and slightly more technical answer is: “I don’t know, can you?”

To expand on this: nobody knows whether you can add a certain mod or not. Adding to, changing, or removing from the list isn’t a yes/no question. In 99.9% of cases, the answer is, “Yes, but…“

The “but…” part of that answer refers to the process of installing any mod and stems from a deeply rooted belief that mods are either compatible with each other, or they are not. Assuming that any mod is (or is not) compatible with any other mod is absurd. Every mod can be made to work with every other mod, the real questions you should be asking are: “How much work would it take to add this mod?” and “Do I have the knowledge, tools, and skills to add this mod?”

And unfortunately, the answer to those questions is a resounding, unequivocal, “It depends.” And it depends on the answers to these questions, which you, and only you, can answer: Does it require compatibility/consistency patching in xEdit? Does it require modifications in Creation Kit? Does it require that it be loaded in a certain place in the load order? Does it need additional mods (which also require answers to these questions) to function?

Lastly, I (ForgottenGlory) and the Living Skyrim development team do not support this in any way, shape, or form. If you’re going to add a mod to Living Skyrim, you need to be prepared to do it on your own. I understand this isn’t an ideal answer for people relatively new to modding, but you need to understand that hundreds of hours have been spent putting together Living Skyrim, making it as stable as possible with all the mods working in harmony. Adding a bunch of random mods on top of it and then expecting it to “just work” is naive at best.

“Can I add a mod to Living Skyrim?”

I don’t know, can you?
