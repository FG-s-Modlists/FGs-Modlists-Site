### The Population Mods
Living Skyrim wouldn't be complete without an entire set of mods to increase the population of the world. [Immersive College NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9252), [Inconsequential NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36334), and [Citizens of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069) make up the core of the population increasing mods, fleshing out cities and towns with tons of new NPCs to interact with. On the enemy side of things, [Unlimited Hostile Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67479) and [Hand Placed Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59249) increase the enemy count of the world. You'll need to prepare heavily to take on larger dungeons or bring along some followers.

To round out the population mods, we also have [Immersive Patrols](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/718), [Man Those Borders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29502), and [Populated Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29452). Overall, the world is jam-packed with people.

### The Magic Mods
[Smart Cast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32847) has returned in Living Skyrim 4. With Smart Cast you can set up specific rules and conditions under which spells will be cast for you - assuming you have the magicka to cast them. It also lets you combine spells into a single cast, again, assuming you have the magicka to cast them both at the same time. This mod has quite a few features available, reading its mod page is highly recommended.

[Spellforge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46482) completely changes how your character learns new spells. Instead of "eating" the book and learning the spell, you now craft the spells you want from the Spellforge, which can be found just beside the bridge leading to the College of Winterhold, or alternatively you can buy the Spellforge Manual at any novice vendor, such as court mages. From the Spellforge, you can craft spells using handy and informative menus, using Arcane Resin as a resource to do so. More in-depth info can be found in-game or on the modpage.

[Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839), [Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170), and [The Elder Scrolls - Tomebound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21403) make up the mods adding new spells to Living Skyrim. Between all of these and the additional options found below, it is possible to have multiple mage playthroughs and never do the same build twice.

[Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138), [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099), and [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) are all included to make magic as diverse as possible with a huge breadth of options. Pilgrim covers the religious aspect of the game, Thaumaturgy covers enchantments, and Mundus covers the various standing stones of the world.

### The Combat Mods
The core of combat in LS4 is comprised of [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) and [MCO - ADXP](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/mods/attack), the former being a modern combat overhaul, complete with a custom stamina system and timed block mechanics, the latter being an animation overhaul for all attacks, bringing attack commitment and general combat gameplay more in line with modern action RPGs. To compliment this, [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) allows you to dodge attacks, and [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) brings hitstop, swing trails, and realistic collision for a very tight and modern feeling combat package. Additionally, [Know Your Enemy Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) brings new depth to fights, allowing you to deal with enemies easier with a bit of planning. The [Archery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10926) mod brings more realistic archery gameplay, with faster arrows and gravity to overhaul ranged combat.

### The Perks & Leveling Mods
At the core of the Living Skyrim leveling up process is [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), which changes how you level up to require you to complete quests, explore, and clear dungeons. To make this process more rewarding, we've also included [Achieve That]() and [Perks From Questing](). You'll also find overhauled perk trees from [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191), [Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639), and [Manbeast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746). Living Skyrim also includes [Reading is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026) to make finding skill books more incentivizing.

### The Economy & Loot Mods
The economy in Living Skyrim is built to be as dynamic and interesting as the rest of the list, starting with [Economy Overhaul and Speechcraft Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9542). Similarly, you'll also find the inclusion of [NPC Bartering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21307) and [Trade Routes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12358) to make trade something you can engage with fully. For completeness, [Khajiits Steal Too](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18231) is included to round out the caravaneer experience.

On the loot side of things, we start with [Loot Overhaul - Rarity and Abundance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26732). This makes loot more dynamic and interesting, especially when coupled with [Dynamic Dungeon Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10308), [Narrative Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12812), and [Lock Related Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11342). For you treasure hunters out there, Living Skyrim also includes [New Treasure Hunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19469).

### The HUD/Menu Mods
As with all versions of Living Skyrim, the HUD and menus have been completely overhauled. At the base, we have [Nordic UI]() to bring a consistent and much improved look to the entire menu and HUD setup. You'll also find your usual suspects like [moreHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12688), [A Matter of Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12937), [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252), and [TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775). Living Skyrim also includes a number of additions and improvements to the vanilla HUD experience such as a custom main menu setup, [Detection Meter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63057), [Oxygen Meter 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64532), [Security Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58224), [Atlas Map Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104), and [Compass Navigation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74484).

### Player Homes
Living Skyrim features a number of new and improved player homes to suit all your characters' needs. Several quest mods such as [Clockwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155), [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996), and [Helgen Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5673) also include player homes that you can earn by completing those quests.

### The Stealth Mods
You'll find stealth to be much more difficult and less of an "easy button" in Living Skyrim. This is thanks to mods such as [Realistic AI Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345), [Suspicious City Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38762), and [Store Entrance Doorbells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56196). To help you out, though, [Mum's The Word](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27713) and [Better Stealth AI for Followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17600) are also included.

### Crafting Mods
Most of the crafting systems in the game have been overhauled. This is primarily thanks to [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) and [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138). For smithing, [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) is included allowing you to order specific items if you don't have the necessary skill to make them. Be warned, though, the items ordered with Honed Metal are very expensive!

To make self-crafting more convenient, [Linked Crafting Storage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64772) is also included.

### ImMuRsHuN & Miscellaneous Mods
For your roleplaying pleasure, an entire host of mods have been added to improve that area of the game. From [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667), which allows you to go camping, to [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001), you'll find the game as "immersive" as you like. Some realism mods in the form of [Wash That Blood Off](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62358), [Wade In Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71418), [Sit on Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74446), and [Simply Knock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14098) are also included allowing you to interact with the world itself in new ways. 

[Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) and [Skyrim's Paraglider](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256) are included to change how you can travel across the land. Changing how you traverse dungeons is [EVG Animated Traversal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) and several realistic animations have been added thanks to [EVG Conditional Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006). [Take Notes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13570) is included as well, allowing you to chronicle your journey.

### Dungeons & New Lands
Several new sets of dungeons and entire new lands have been added to the game. [Hammet's Dungeon Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186) adds many extremely high quality dungeons to the world and [Dungeons - Revisited](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51798) expands many of the existing dungeons in the world. On the new lands side of things, we have [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), and [New Vominheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70963). Several quests also add new areas to explore, such as [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), [Carved Brink](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24351), [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996), and [Moon and Star](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4301).
