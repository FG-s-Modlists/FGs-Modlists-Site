  Information about Living Skyrim's performance profile.
---

Living Skyrim 4 ships with 2 different profiles, those being the Standard profile and the Performance profile. The latter of such is ideal for use if you're not quite getting your desired performance out of the Standard profile. MO2's Profile selector, located in the top left, just above the mods pane, allows you to easily swap between the two. A visual representation of such can be [found here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034149881390051482/1047990987139600414/image.png).

Saves are compatible between the two profiles, though you will need transfer the saves. You can easily do so by clicking the Profile selection dropdown and clicking <Manage>. In the window that opens up, click the profile you are currently on, click the Transfer Saves button, then transfer the saves over to the Global location (left hand side). From there, close that window and select the profile you'd like to switch to, click Transfer Saves again, then transfer your saves from the Global location to the new profile.
