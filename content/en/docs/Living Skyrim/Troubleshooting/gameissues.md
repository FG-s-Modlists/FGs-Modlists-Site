Start the main quest and progress it to at least Way of the Voice. See above questions for how to start the main quest.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-4" title="I can't use spells with a weapon equipped! I Can't power attack!" >}}

Engarde changes the way these combat functions work. To use a spell in your characters *right* hand: hold the Modifier hotkey while you right click (default Shift)
Please note that swapping mouse buttons for attacks can cause issues with this. You will need to configure things yourself if you do this.
Power attacks have their own keybind (Default Mouse 3). These can be changed at any time in the Engarde MCM

{{< scrollable-block id="q-5" title="Can I access RaceMenu after character creation?" >}}

Only if you are not changing your character’s gender or race. Changing gender/race will cause issues with powers and passive buffs your character has.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-6" title="My screen is zoomed in or weirdly off-center." >}}

Check the SSE Display Tweaks INI file to make sure you have the resolution for your screen set correctly. You may also need to check BethINI or the Skyrim INI files to make sure they all match your screen’s resolution.

{{</ scrollable-block >}}

{{< scrollable-block id="q-7" title="How can I adjust graphical/resolution settings?" >}}

A program called BethINI is included with the Living Skyrim installation. You can find it in the `Living Skyrim\Tools\BethINI` folder. Run the program (**MAKE SURE Mod Organizer IS CLOSED**) and adjust your settings as necessary.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-8" title="Interiors are too dark or bright." >}}

Instructions here are for the default ENB, if you have changed it you will need to search for the settings on your own. Open the ENB configuration menu in game with `Shift+Enter` Navigate to the `ENBEffect.fx` menu on the right side of the configuration screen. You will see two options near the top of this section, The first is the `Nights` modifier, Set this to a lower number between 0.5 and 1 to make nights brighter outdoors. Set it to a number between 1 and 2 to make them darker. Repeat this for the `Interiors` setting using the same number scale. Press **Save Configuration** in the top left and then close the menu using `Shift+Enter` again. ***DO NOT CLICK APPLY CHANGES*** This will load the configuration from the .ini file and you will lose your changes.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-9" title="MO2 cannot find SKSE." >}}

You’ll need to manually set the path for SKSE using the Edit Executables menu in MO2. Set it to `[install folder]\Stock Game\skse64_loader.exe`. Alternatively your Antivirus software may be interfering with the installation, set exceptions and/or disable as necessary.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-10" title="Can I use a controller?" >}}

I strongly advise against it. With as many mods as there are in the list, you’ll need a full breadth of keyboard keys to activate and use every feature. If you absolutely must play with a controller, please, for the love of all that is holy, use Gamepad++.

{{</ scrollable-block >}}

{{< scrollable-block id="q-11" title="My game freezes when saving." >}}

Make sure you’ve disabled all overlays for Skyrim. The most common ones are Discord, Steam, and nVidia. Other overlays from things like MSI Afterburner and f.lux have also been known to cause issues.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-12" title="Can I play this list on a 75/100/144hz screen?" >}}

Yes. Display Tweaks SSE is included to allow higher refresh rates.

{{</ scrollable-block >}}

{{< scrollable-block id="q-13" title="Can I use this list on an ultrawide monitor?" >}}

Yes, Nordic UI patches for 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios are included by default. Just make sure to enable the correct version for your aspect ratio in the left pane of MO2 under the 'Configuration Specific' seperator.

{{< scrollable-block id="q-14" title="Nudity?" >}}

By default, Living Skyrim has every character be never nude. Underwear is worn by all NPCs and the player character and cannot be unequipped. Support is not provided for making the list Nude.
