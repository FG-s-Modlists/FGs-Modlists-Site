This is unsupported and unrecommended per Rule 11.

{{< alert color="danger" title="Rule 11">}}
<div class="alert-icon">ðŸ›‘</div>
If you make modifications to these Modlists, you do so at your own risk. Unless otherwise specified, no support will be provided. Asking for support modding a list should be done within the Modding category on the Discord server. Additionally, do not suggest that someone break Rule 11 in an effort to fix issues with a list.
{{< /alert >}}

Also, if you have to ask, you probably shouldn't be trying to add mods to the list.
