  How do I turn on autosaves?
---

In modlists created by ForgottenGlory, autosaves are turned off. Why? Well, autosaves can sometimes activate while scripts in the game are running. If that happens, there's a risk that you won't be able to load that saved game in the future.

To ensure your gaming progress is saved:

1. Familiarize yourself with the quicksave button. By default, it's the F5 key. Think of it as your game's safety net.
2. Always save before you hit a loading screen. Why? After a loading screen, there are often scripts running in the background. If you decide to save just after the loading screen, give it about 30 seconds. This pause ensures that all scripts have completed their actions.
3. Steer clear of saving during battles. In the thick of combat, the game is busy with many scripts. Saving during this time can risk corrupting your save.
4. And here's another tip: Don't overwrite the same save game repeatedly. This can gradually degrade the integrity of the save. Also, if you see a 'Quicksave' option in the escape menu, it's better to ignore it. Stick with the 'Save' option in the menu or use the F5 quicksave hotkey.

By following these steps, you'll make sure your game progresses smoothly and your adventures in Skyrim remain uninterrupted. Safe adventuring!
