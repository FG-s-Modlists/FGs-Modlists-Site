## Changing ENB Settings

To change ENB settings, press Shift + Enter while in-game. This will open the ENB control panel. You can tweak the settings of ENB using this control panel.

## Disabling ENB

To toggle ENB on and off while in-game, press Shift + F12. Disabling ENB can have massive performance effects, and is highly recommended for people with computer specifications close to the minimum recommended specs.
