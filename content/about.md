   - The TUCO Modding Team - Their modlist is a great way to get a Vanilla+ experience with a tutorial that is extremely helpful for learning the basics of creating a modlist.
   - DarkLadyLexy - Her LotD list is an invaluable resource not only for an awesome modlist, but also for learning many fundamentals of modding and compiling a modlist.
   - EzioTheDeadPoet - For their SME(FT) modlist. The ability to start from scratch on a whim while building this list has been invaluable.
