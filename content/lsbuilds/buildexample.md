# Example LS3 Build (Two-Handed Barbarian)

## Race

Nord or Orc.

## CC&B

Choose the Barbarian class if you want access to Archery, or make a custom class with the following:

- Specialization | Combat
- Major Skills | Speech, Block, One-handed, Smithing, Two-handed, Light Armor
- Class Ability | Ruthless - 10% Bonus to melee damage

Birthsign: Pick either The Warrior, The Lover, or The Steed

## AVA
Assign attributes as follows using 18 points. The following assumes Nord, but the same is true of Orc: Strength, Fortitude, Endurance, Agility, and Dexterity are your most important attributes.

- Strength: 16 (4)
- Fortitude: 11 (3)
- Endurance: 10 (4)
- Intelligence: 6 (0)
- Wisdom: 8 (0)
- Perception: 8 (0)

- Dexterity: 11 (3)
- Charisma: 10 (0)
- Luck: 10 (0)

## ELSA

Pick either Woodcutter or Tanner.

## Standing Stone

The Lover (or The Warrior) is useful to start out with, but eventually you'll want to switch to The Lady.

## Perks
The only two trees that are really required are Light Armor and Two-Handed. Otherwise, pick whatever perks you want.

- Light Armor: Light Armor Mastery, Agility, Light Armor Fit, Keen Senses, Windrunner, Light Armor Training, Wardancer, Matching Light Set, Evasive Sprint, Untouchable
- Two-Handed: Two-Handed Mastery, Brutal Fighter, Overbearing Assault OR Mortal Wounds OR Crushing Blows, Ferocious Strength, Berserker, Warmaster, Coup de Grace OR Hook Blade OR Shattering Strike, Bear Hide, Sweep, Crowd Pleaser

## Items

The best two-handed weapon you can find, but make sure to specialize in one type of two-handed weapon: either greatswords, battleaxes, or warhammers. Don't try to use all three, pick one type and stick with it. 

Similarly, the best light armor you can find. Once you get the Matching Light Set perk, try to make sure your armor matches across all its pieces. 

Enchantments that affect power attacks, two-handed damage, and light armor rating are the most important. Health and stamina regeneration or leech is also extremely useful.

## Spells

None. You have a big stick, hit them with it til they die. Or you die, whichever comes first. Victory or Sovngarde and all that.
